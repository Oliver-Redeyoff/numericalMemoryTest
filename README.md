## Questions answers

### How long did you spend writing the application?
In total I spent around 6 hours on this project.

### What part of the application are you most proud of?
I am most proud of the react test component, as getting all the timers to work properly together was slightly challenging at first.
Equally, I very much like the graph given in the results summary, although I can't take much credit for this as it comes from a library.

### If you had more time what would you improve in the application
If I had more time, I would work first of all on giving a more detailed results summary, including a list of the answers that the user gave and wherever the user got that number right or not.
I would equally work more on the backend, as not much work is done on this end in this project. I would especially want to set up a database where each user results summaries would be stored, so that a recruiter for example could see scores associated with individuals.
